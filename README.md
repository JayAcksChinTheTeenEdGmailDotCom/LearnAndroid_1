# LearnAndroid_1
This is a learning experience by mimicking a live mobile app's front end interface.

This project is targeted at Android 9.0(Pie) API 28.
I am using Kotlin 1.3 and Android Studio 3
I've installed
- Android Material Design Icon Generator v1.9 plugin

Device used for development tests
- Xiaomi A1 equipped with Android One OS

In this project I learnt how to
- start an Intent to next activity and pass/read values in Extra
- populate(or inflate) a RecyclerView using an Adapter/ViewHolder class with data from RoomDatabase.
- insert into and delete from the database
- attach event listener in ViewHolder and handle it in activity
- write custom functions to calculate and display hours and minutes
- use startActivityForResult and onActivityResult() function to use the values in Extra from previous activity
- launch a GoogleMap in a fragment and show in other activity

Things I need to read up on
- companion object {}
- .invoke()
- implement permission checks
- move and zoom to My Location on map ready
- theme and style
